# A lockfile conflict is never resolved by hand: Cargo rebuilds it from the
# merged manifests. When the three-way merge is clean it is kept. Otherwise
# this keeps our side. A merge records that the lockfile is stale, and the
# pre-commit or pre-merge-commit hook runs Cargo before that merge is
# committed, once every Cargo.toml has its merged contents. Cherry-picks,
# reverts, and rebases commit without those hooks, so they stop with the
# lockfile conflicted instead.
